Create an algorithm that takes an array of objects that contains following properties:
- symbol: string
- next24HoursBias: string
---
Possible values for next24HoursBias are:
- Strong Bullish
- Medium Bullish
- Weak Bullish
- Neutral
- Bearish
- Medium Bearish
- Strong Bearish
- undefined
---
Possible values for symbol are:
- USD
- EUR
- GBP
- JPY
- CHF
- CAD
- AUD
- NZD
- XAU
- XAG
- XPT
- XPD
---
Considerations:
- symbol is unique
- next24HoursBias is not unique
- next24HoursBias can be undefined
---
Create other array of objects that contains following properties:
- pair: string
- trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'neutral'
- leftSymbol: string
- rightSymbol: string
- score: number
---
Possible values for pair are:
- EURUSD
- GBPUSD
- USDJPY
- USDCHF
- USDCAD
- AUDUSD
- NZDUSD
- XAUUSD
- XAGUSD
- XPTUSD
- XPDUSD
- XTIUSD
---
Considerations:
- pair is unique
- trend is not unique
- score is not unique
- trend can be 'up', 'down' or 'neutral'
- score can be any number
---
Now, create a function that takes the first array of objects and returns the second array of objects. this function should:
- filter the first array of objects by next24HoursBias !== 'undefined'  
- combine each symbol with each pair
- calculate the score based on the next24HoursBias and the trend
- sort the second array of objects by score
- return the second array of objects
---
The score should be calculated as follows:
- if rightSymbol === 'STRONG'
